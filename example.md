## Deployment

Before starting the kafka server we need to start the zookeeper server first :

```bash
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
```



```bash
 df = pd.read_csv('HEART.csv') 

```


```bash
  df.head() # checking whether the data set contains the right features 
```


```bash
 df.shape # checking the total number of rows and columns
  
```
